# This is the README file for part-2 of the assignment

You will find the run configurations. Run the server first and then run the client

If you do not have IntelliJ installed then you can use your terminal.

`cd part-2`

RUN SERVER

`mvn -pl server spring-boot:run`

RUN CLIENT

`mvn -pl client spring-boot:run`
